## Frontend Hacks

- Make sure to:
  - call and build a table of your text API
  - call and build an image from your image API

EXTRA CREDIT:
- add data to the table differently than from how we did
- style ```index.html``` with SCSS or CSS

Do this in ```index.html```.

RUNNING LOCALLY: 

To run this as a local server, which you will need to do in order to complete the hacks, you will need to install Ruby Virtual Machine (RVM). This is much faster than docker and is, as a result, more efficient. 

BEFORE INSTALLING RUBY VIRTUAL MACHINE, make sure that you are running on anaconda, where there is ```(base)``` in front of everything in your command prompt.

1. Install RVM with this command: ```\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable```
2. Check the version of RVM by using ```ruby -v```. MAKE SURE THAT IT RESPONDS WITH ```ruby 2.7.7```. If you are having trouble installing RVM, contact us immediately so that we can help you in class if possible.
